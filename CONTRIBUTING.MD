# Contributing to MONK

The following guidelines should assure seamless and qualitative integration of your future contributions to the MONK ecosystem. 

Contributions thereby may include but are not limited to the integration of 3rd-party modules to the <a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-modules">MONK Modulestore</a> (via PRs),
developments for our <a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-app">MONK-App</a> and involved packages (via PRs),
bug fixing, beeing an excellent community member and help filing issues either for <a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-app/issues">MONK-App</a>/<a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-modules/issues">MONK-Modules</a> or providing valuable feedback in any sense. 

Community members who gained our trust and demonstrated strong commitment may be granted with commit access and join the MONK core team in the future. 

Most importantly as stated in our code of conduct: "Be excellent to each other"


## Contributing with MONK-modules:

Before starting to `#hackaway` with your module, we recommend to get in touch with our MONK audit team first either by filing an issue on
<a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-modules/issues">MONK-Modules</a> or via Mail. Thereby, we know what you are up to
and could provide you valuable feedback from our expert community as well as potential users.
